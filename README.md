# Evidences-Manager


An application based on CRUD (create, read, update and delete) operations that provides a GUI made with QT.
It features 2 modes: Senior Clearance Mode and Standard Clearance Mode.
In the Senior Clearance Mode you can add, remove, delete and see all the evidences.
In the Standard Clearance Level you can see evideces with given characteristics (measurement and quantity), one by one, and you can save them sepparately.

In the storageChoice file, there will always be a digit: 0 or 1. 0 means that everything will be saved in memory and 1 means that everything will be saved in provided files.

For mylist files, you can use .txt, .csv and .html files for storage.

There are already 10 evidences as initial data.
